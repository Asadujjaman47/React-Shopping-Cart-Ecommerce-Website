## Lessons Learned
  
During the development of this project, I have learned the following:

- Using **React**: I have learned how to use React to build a simple ecommerce website. 
- Using **React Router**: I have used React Router to handle the routing of the application.  
- Using **Context API**: I have used the Context API to manage the state of the application and share data between components. 
- Using **useState Hook**: I have used the useState Hook to manage state within a functional component. 
- Using **CSS**: I have used CSS to style the components and make the website look visually appealing. 
- Using **Yarn**: I have used Yarn as a package manager to install the necessary dependencies for the project. 
- Using **Vite:** I have used Vite as a build tool to run the development server and bundle the application for production.

These are valuable skills that I can apply to building more complex web applications in the future.
